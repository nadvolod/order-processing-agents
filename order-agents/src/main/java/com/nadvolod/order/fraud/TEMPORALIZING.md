## Understanding the Basics

### The Restaurant Analogy

Think of Temporal like a restaurant:

| Component | Restaurant Role | What It Does |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Activities** | Cooks, waiters, cashiers | Do the actual work (call APIs, databases) |
| **Workflow** | Recipe/instructions | Says what order to do things |
| **Worker** | The restaurant building | Houses the workers, stays open 24/7 |
| **Starter** | Customer placing an order | Kicks off a new workflow |
| **Temporal Server** | Post office | Manages communication and state |

### Key Concepts

**Activity** = A single step that can fail and retry independently
- Example: "Check fraud", "Charge payment", "Send email"
- Can do I/O operations (API calls, database queries)
- Temporal automatically retries them if they fail

**Workflow** = The orchestrator that coordinates activities
- Example: "First check fraud, then charge payment, then send confirmation"
- Cannot do I/O directly (must use activities)
- Temporal tracks state between activities

**The Big Picture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Temporal Server (localhost:7233)       │
│  - Stores workflow state                │
│  - Manages task queues                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↑                    ↑
           │                    │
    ┌──────┴──────┐      ┌─────┴──────┐
    │   Worker    │      │  Starter   │
    │  (listens)  │      │ (triggers) │
    └─────────────┘      └────────────┘
```

## Step 1: Create Activity Interfaces

### What Are Activity Interfaces?

Activity interfaces are "contracts" that tell Temporal: "These steps can be executed by workers."

### The Pattern

Every activity interface follows this pattern:

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface MyActivity {

    @ActivityMethod
    OutputType doSomething(InputType input);
}
```

That's it! Just an interface with special annotations.

### Your Mission

Create **3 activity interfaces** in the `com.nadvolod.order.fraud.temporal` package:

#### 1. FraudDetectionActivity

**Questions to answer:**
- What does this activity do? (Analyzes orders for fraud)
- What input does it need? (Hint: Look at `FraudDetectionAgent.analyze()`)
- What does it return? (Hint: What does the agent return?)

**Template:**
```java
package com.nadvolod.order.fraud.temporal;

import ____;  // What imports do you need?

@ActivityInterface
public interface FraudDetectionActivity {

    @ActivityMethod
    ____ detectFraud(____);  // Fill in return type and parameter
}
```

**Hints:**
- Look at `FraudDetectionAgent.java` to see what the method signature should be
- Input: `OrderRequest`
- Output: `FraudDetectionResult`

#### 2. PaymentChargeActivity

**Questions:**
- What does this activity do?
- Look at `FraudPaymentService.chargeCard()` - what parameters does it take?
- What does it return?

**Your turn to write it!** Follow the same pattern as above.

#### 3. ConfirmationMessageActivity

**Questions:**
- What does this activity do?
- Look at `ConfirmationMessageAgent.generate()` - what does it need?
- What does it return?

**Your turn to write it!**

**✅ Checkpoint:** You should have 3 interface files with `@ActivityInterface` and `@ActivityMethod` annotations.

---

## Step 2: Create Activity Implementations

### Understanding the Pattern

Activities are **thin wrappers** around existing code. Think of them like a phone - you don't do the talking yourself, you just hold the phone and let someone else talk through it.

### The Universal Pattern

```java
public class MyActivityImpl implements MyActivity {

    // 1. Store the real worker
    private final RealWorker worker;

    // 2. Receive it via constructor
    public MyActivityImpl(RealWorker worker) {
        this.worker = worker;
    }

    // 3. Delegate to the worker
    @Override
    public Result doSomething(Input input) {
        return worker.doActualWork(input);  // Just delegate!
    }
}
```

**That's all an Activity implementation does - delegate!**

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong - Doing work in the activity:**
```java
@Override
public Result doSomething(Input input) {
    // Lots of logic here
    // Making API calls here
    // BAD!
}
```

✅ **Right - Delegating to existing code:**
```java
@Override
public Result doSomething(Input input) {
    return service.doWork(input);  // Just delegate!
}
```

### Your Mission

Create **3 activity implementations**:

#### 1. FraudDetectionActivityImpl

**Questions:**
- What does the real fraud detection work? (`FraudDetectionAgent`)
- What method should you call on it? (`.analyze()`)
- What should the constructor receive? (The agent!)

**Template:**
```java
public class FraudDetectionActivityImpl implements FraudDetectionActivity {

    private final ____ agent;  // What type?

    public FraudDetectionActivityImpl(____) {  // What parameter?
        this.agent = ____;
    }

    @Override
    public ____ detectFraud(____) {  // Fill in the signature
        return agent.____(____)  // What method? What parameter?
    }
}
```

**Think:** This is just 5-10 lines of code. Keep it simple!

#### 2. PaymentChargeActivityImpl

**Questions:**
- What service does the real payment work? (`FraudPaymentService`)
- What method charges a card? (`.chargeCard()`)
- What parameters does it need?

**Your turn!** Use the same pattern.

#### 3. ConfirmationMessageActivityImpl

**Questions:**
- What agent generates messages? (`ConfirmationMessageAgent`)
- What method does it use?

**Your turn!**

**✅ Checkpoint:** 6 files total (3 interfaces + 3 implementations), each implementation is only 5-10 lines.

---

## Step 3: Create Workflow Interface

### What's a Workflow Interface?

It's the "entry point" - when someone starts a workflow, which method gets called?

### The Pattern

```java
@WorkflowInterface
public interface MyWorkflow {

    @WorkflowMethod
    FinalResult processEverything(InitialInput input);
}
```

### Your Mission: FraudOrderWorkflow Interface

**Questions:**
- What's the input to start the workflow? (What represents an order?)
- What's the final output? (What's the complete result?)
- What should the method be called? (Suggestion: `processOrder`)

**Template:**
```java
package com.nadvolod.order.fraud.temporal;

import ____;  // Import the domain classes

@WorkflowInterface
public interface FraudOrderWorkflow {

    @WorkflowMethod
    ____ ____(____);  // Fill in: return type, method name, parameter
}
```

**Hints:**
- Input: `OrderRequest` (same as FraudOrderProcessor)
- Output: `FraudOrderResponse` (same as FraudOrderProcessor)
- Method name: `processOrder`

**✅ Checkpoint:** One simple interface, looks similar to an Activity interface.

---

## Step 4: Create Workflow Implementation

### Understanding Workflow Implementation

This is where you convert your `FraudOrderProcessor` logic to use Temporal.

**Key insight:** You already wrote this logic! You're just changing WHO does the work.

### Before vs After

**Before (FraudOrderProcessor):**
```java
FraudDetectionResult fraudCheck = fraudAgent.analyze(request);
```

**After (Workflow):**
```java
FraudDetectionResult fraudCheck = fraudActivity.detectFraud(request);
```

Same logic, different caller!

### Understanding Activity Stubs

Activity stubs are like TV remote controls:
- You press a button (call a method)
- The TV (worker) does the actual work
- You don't need to know HOW it works

**Creating a stub:**
```java
private final MyActivity myActivity = Workflow.newActivityStub(
    MyActivity.class,
    ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
        .setRetryOptions(RetryOptions.newBuilder()
            .setMaximumAttempts(3)
            .build())
        .build()
);
```

**What this means:**
- "Create a remote control for MyActivity"
- "Each attempt can take up to 30 seconds"
- "If it fails, retry up to 3 times"

### Understanding Retry Options

```java
.setMaximumAttempts(5)  // Try 5 times total
.setInitialInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))  // Wait 1 second before retry #1
.setMaximumInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(10))  // Maximum wait is 10 seconds
.setBackoffCoefficient(2.0)  // Double the wait each time
```

**Example timeline:**
- Attempt 1 fails → Wait 1 second
- Attempt 2 fails → Wait 2 seconds (1 × 2)
- Attempt 3 fails → Wait 4 seconds (2 × 2)
- Attempt 4 fails → Wait 8 seconds (4 × 2)
- Attempt 5 fails → Wait 10 seconds (capped at max)

This is **exponential backoff**.

### Your Mission: FraudOrderWorkflowImpl

#### Part A: Create Activity Stubs

Create **3 activity stubs** as private fields:

**Stub 1: Fraud Detection**
```java
private final FraudDetectionActivity fraudActivity =
    Workflow.newActivityStub(
        ____.class,  // What activity interface?
        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
            .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
            .setRetryOptions(RetryOptions.newBuilder()
                .setMaximumAttempts(3)  // How many retries?
                .setInitialInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
                .setMaximumInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                .setBackoffCoefficient(2.0)
                .build())
            .build()
    );
```

**Stub 2: Payment**
```java
private final ____ paymentActivity =
    Workflow.newActivityStub(
        ____.class,
        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
            .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))  // Faster timeout
            .setRetryOptions(RetryOptions.newBuilder()
                .setMaximumAttempts(5)  // More retries for payment!
                // ... same retry config
                .build())
            .build()
    );
```

**Question:** Why 5 retries for payment but only 3 for fraud detection?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Payment APIs often have transient network failures. More retries = better success rate!
</details>

**Stub 3: Confirmation**

Your turn! Follow the same pattern as fraud detection.

#### Part B: Implement the Workflow Method

**Strategy:** Open `FraudOrderProcessor.java` and copy the `processOrder` logic, then make these changes:

**Changes to make:**
1. Remove all `System.out.println` statements (Temporal has its own logging)
2. Change `fraudAgent.analyze()` to `fraudActivity.detectFraud()`
3. Change `paymentService.chargeCard()` to `paymentActivity.chargeCard()`
4. Change `confirmationAgent.generate()` to `confirmationActivity.generateMessage()`

**Template:**
```java
@Override
public FraudOrderResponse processOrder(OrderRequest request) {
    // STEP 1: Fraud Detection
    FraudDetectionResult fraudCheck = fraudActivity.____(____)  // What method? What parameter?

    if (!fraudCheck.approved()) {
        // Copy the rejection logic from FraudOrderProcessor
        // But use confirmationActivity instead of confirmationAgent
        // ...
        return rejectedResponse;
    }

    // STEP 2: Payment
    double amount = ____  // How do you calculate this? (Copy from FraudOrderProcessor)
    PaymentChargeResult payment = paymentActivity.____(____, ____)

    if (!payment.success()) {
        // Copy the failure logic
        // ...
        return failedResponse;
    }

    // STEP 3: Confirmation
    // Copy the success logic
    // ...
    return successResponse;
}
```

**Pro tip:** You can literally copy-paste from `FraudOrderProcessor.java` and just change the method calls!

**✅ Checkpoint:** Workflow implementation should look almost identical to FraudOrderProcessor, just using activity stubs instead of direct service calls.

## Step 5: Create the Worker

### What Is a Worker?

The worker is a process that:
1. Connects to Temporal Server
2. Says: "I can execute these workflows and activities!"
3. Waits for work
4. Executes work when it arrives
5. Runs forever (until you stop it)

**🏪 Restaurant Analogy:**

Think of the Worker as a **restaurant that's open 24/7**:
- The restaurant **connects to DoorDash** (Temporal Server)
- It says: **"We can make pizza and burgers!"** (registers workflows and activities)
- It **waits for orders** to come in
- When an order arrives, the **kitchen staff does the work** (executes activities)
- The restaurant **never closes** - it's always ready for the next order!

**Visualization:**

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           WORKER PROCESS                  │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Workflows Registered:              │  │
│  │  ✓ FraudOrderWorkflowImpl           │  │
│  │                                     │  │
│  │  Activities Registered:             │  │
│  │  ✓ FraudDetectionActivityImpl       │  │
│  │  ✓ PaymentChargeActivityImpl        │  │
│  │  ✓ ConfirmationMessageActivityImpl  │  │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                           │
│  Status: 👂 LISTENING on "fraud-order-   │
│           processing" queue               │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↕
        (polling Temporal Server)
                    ↕
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         TEMPORAL SERVER                   │
│   Task Queue: "fraud-order-processing"    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**💡 Key Insight:** The Worker is like a **vending machine** - it sits there running, waiting for someone to press a button (trigger a workflow). When a workflow is triggered, it springs into action!

### The Worker Pattern

Every worker follows this structure:

```java
public class WorkerApp {
    private static final String TASK_QUEUE = "my-queue-name";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Connect to Temporal
        WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
        WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);

        // 2. Create worker
        WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);
        Worker worker = factory.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);

        // 3. Register workflow
        worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(MyWorkflowImpl.class);

        // 4. Create and register activities
        // (with their dependencies)

        // 5. Start!
        factory.start();
    }
}
```

### Your Mission: WorkerApp.java

#### Part A: Setup

**Choose a task queue name:** (Suggestion: `"fraud-order-processing"`)

**Important:** Remember this name! It must match in the Starter!

```java
private static final String TASK_QUEUE = "____";  // Your queue name
```

#### Part B: Connect to Temporal

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Connect to Temporal Server (running on localhost:7233)
    WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);

    System.out.println("Connected to Temporal!");
}
```

#### Part C: Create Worker

```java
// Create worker factory
WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);

// Create worker for your task queue
Worker worker = factory.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);

System.out.println("Worker created for queue: " + TASK_QUEUE);
```

#### Part D: Register Workflow

```java
// Tell the worker what workflow it can run
worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(____.class);  // Your workflow impl!

System.out.println("Registered workflow");
```

#### Part E: Create Activity Dependencies

**This is the tricky part!** Your activity implementations need dependencies.

**Look at `FraudOrderProcessingApp.java`** - it creates all these dependencies already!

**Questions:**
- What does `FraudDetectionActivityImpl` need? (An agent)
- What does `PaymentChargeActivityImpl` need? (A payment service)
- What does `ConfirmationMessageActivityImpl` need? (An agent)

**Copy this pattern from FraudOrderProcessingApp:**
```java
// Create AI agents (OpenAI or Stub)
var apiKey = System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY");
FraudDetectionAgent fraudAgent;
ConfirmationMessageAgent confirmationAgent;

if (apiKey != null && !apiKey.isBlank()) {
    // Create OpenAI versions
    fraudAgent = new ____(____, "gpt-4o-mini");
    confirmationAgent = new ____(____, "gpt-4o-mini");
} else {
    // Create stub versions
    fraudAgent = new ____();
    confirmationAgent = new ____();
}

// Create payment service with 70% failure rate for demonstrating retries
FraudPaymentService paymentService = new FakeCardPaymentService(0.7);
```

#### Part F: Create Activity Implementations

```java
// Create activity implementations with their dependencies
FraudDetectionActivityImpl fraudActivity = new FraudDetectionActivityImpl(____);  // Pass agent
PaymentChargeActivityImpl paymentActivity = new PaymentChargeActivityImpl(____);  // Pass service
ConfirmationMessageActivityImpl confirmationActivity = new ConfirmationMessageActivityImpl(____);  // Pass agent
```

#### Part G: Register Activities

```java
// Register all activities with the worker
worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(
    fraudActivity,
    paymentActivity,
    confirmationActivity
);

System.out.println("Registered 3 activities");
```

#### Part H: Start the Worker

```java
// Start the worker (runs forever!)
factory.start();

System.out.println("\n=== WORKER STARTED! ===");
System.out.println("Task Queue: " + TASK_QUEUE);
System.out.println("Listening for workflows...");
System.out.println("Press Ctrl+C to stop\n");
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** Worker should compile and start without errors.

---

## Step 6: Create the Starter

### What Is a Starter?

The starter is a one-time program that:
1. Connects to Temporal
2. Triggers a workflow
3. Waits for the result
4. Displays the result
5. Exits

### The Starter Pattern

```java
public class Starter {
    private static final String TASK_QUEUE = "____";  // Must match Worker!

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Connect to Temporal
        WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
        WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);

        // 2. Create workflow stub
        MyWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
            MyWorkflow.class,
            WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE)
                .setWorkflowId("unique-id")
                .build()
        );

        // 3. Call the workflow
        Result result = workflow.processEverything(input);

        // 4. Display result
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

### Your Mission: Starter.java

#### Part A: Setup

**Important:** Use the SAME task queue name as your Worker!

```java
private static final String TASK_QUEUE = "____";  // Same as Worker!
```

#### Part B: Parse CLI Arguments

**Strategy:** Use the existing CLI parsing from `CLI.java`

You need to support scenarios:
- `low-risk`, `high-risk`, `fraud-test` (payment always succeeds)
- `payment-flaky` (70% failure - demonstrates retries!)
- `payment-broken` (100% failure - demonstrates exhaustion)

**Hint:** Import and use:
- `CLI.parseArgs(args)` for parsing
- `FraudOrderProcessingApp.createOrderForScenario(config.scenario)` for creating orders
- `CLI.printUsage()` for help text

#### Part C: Connect to Temporal

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Parse arguments (you wrote this above)
    CLIConfig config = parseArgs(args);
    OrderRequest request = createOrderForScenario(config.scenario);

    // Connect to Temporal
    WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
}
```

#### Part D: Create Workflow Stub

```java
// Create a "remote control" for the workflow
FraudOrderWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
    ____.class,  // Your workflow interface
    WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
        .setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE)
        .setWorkflowId("fraud-order-" + request.orderId())  // Unique ID
        .build()
);
```

**Question:** Why include the order ID in the workflow ID?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
To make each workflow execution unique and trackable!
</details>

#### Part E: Execute the Workflow

```java
System.out.println("=== Starting Workflow ===");
System.out.println("Order: " + request.orderId());

// Step 3: This is where the magic happens!
FraudOrderResponse response = workflow.____(____)  // What method? What parameter?

System.out.println("=== Workflow Complete ===");
```

**🎯 What happens here?**

When you call `workflow.processOrder(request)`, here's the journey:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Starter   │ 1. Sends work to Temporal
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Temporal Server │ 2. Finds a worker listening on task queue
└──────┬──────────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Worker    │ 3. Executes the workflow
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├──→ 4a. Executes FraudDetectionActivity
       ├──→ 4b. Executes PaymentChargeActivity (with retries!)
       └──→ 4c. Executes ConfirmationMessageActivity
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Worker    │ 5. Returns the result
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Starter   │ 6. Receives the result and displays it
└─────────────┘
```

**Think of it like ordering food delivery:**
1. **You (Starter)** place an order through an app
2. **The app (Temporal Server)** finds a restaurant that can make your food
3. **The restaurant (Worker)** starts cooking
4. **The kitchen staff (Activities)** do the actual cooking tasks
5. **The restaurant** packages everything up
6. **You** receive your delicious food!

**Key insight:** The Starter doesn't do the work itself - it just triggers it and waits for results!

#### Part F: Display Results

**Strategy:** Copy the result display logic from `FraudOrderProcessingApp.java`

Show:
- Order ID and status
- Fraud check details
- Payment details
- Confirmation message

**Complete Example:**

```java
// Step 4: Display results (similar to FraudOrderProcessingApp)
System.out.println("\n=== Final Results ===");
System.out.println("Order ID: " + response.orderId());
System.out.println("Status: " + response.status());

// Add more details based on what's in the response
if (response.fraudCheck() != null) {
    System.out.println("\n=== Fraud Check ===");
    System.out.println("Risk Score: " + response.fraudCheck().riskScore());
    System.out.println("Risk Level: " + response.fraudCheck().riskLevel());
    System.out.println("Approved: " + response.fraudCheck().approved());
    if (!response.fraudCheck().reasons().isEmpty()) {
        System.out.println("Reasons: " + String.join(", ", response.fraudCheck().reasons()));
    }
}

if (response.paymentCharge() != null) {
    System.out.println("\n=== Payment ===");
    System.out.println("Success: " + response.paymentCharge().success());
    System.out.println("Transaction ID: " + response.paymentCharge().transactionId());
    System.out.println("Amount: $" + response.paymentCharge().amount());
    if (response.paymentCharge().errorMessage() != null) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + response.paymentCharge().errorMessage());
    }
}

if (response.confirmation() != null) {
    System.out.println("\n=== Customer Message ===");
    System.out.println("Subject: " + response.confirmation().subject());
    System.out.println("Body: " + response.confirmation().body());
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** Add a link to the Temporal Web UI so you can inspect the workflow execution:

```java
System.out.println("\n=== Temporal Web UI ===");
System.out.println("View workflow execution:");
System.out.println("http://localhost:8233/namespaces/default/workflows/fraud-order-" + request.orderId());
```

**Why this is useful:** The Web UI shows you the complete execution history, all activity retries, timing information, and input/output data for each step. It's like having X-ray vision into your workflow!

**✅ Checkpoint:** Starter should compile and be ready to trigger workflows.

---

## Step 7: Update Maven Configuration

Add execution profiles for your Worker and Starter.

### Edit pom.xml

Find the `<executions>` section in `exec-maven-plugin` and add:

```xml
<execution>
    <id>fraud-worker</id>
    <configuration>
        <mainClass>com.nadvolod.order.fraud.temporal.WorkerApp</mainClass>
    </configuration>
</execution>
<execution>
    <id>fraud-workflow</id>
    <configuration>
        <mainClass>com.nadvolod.order.fraud.temporal.Starter</mainClass>
    </configuration>
</execution>
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** You can now run `mvn exec:java@fraud-worker` and `mvn exec:java@fraud-workflow`.

---

## Step 8: Test Everything

### 8.1: Compile

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

**Expected:** No errors!

### 8.2: Start Temporal Server

In Terminal 1:
```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

**Expected:** Server starts, Web UI available at http://localhost:8233

### 8.3: Start Your Worker

In Terminal 2:
```bash
mvn exec:java@fraud-worker
```

**Expected:**
```
Connected to Temporal!
Worker created for queue: fraud-order-processing
Registered workflow
Using OpenAI API for AI agents
Registered 3 activities

=== WORKER STARTED! ===
Listening for workflows...
```

**Keep this running!**

### 8.4: Trigger a Workflow

In Terminal 3:
```bash
mvn exec:java@fraud-workflow -Dexec.args="low-risk"
```

**Expected:** Workflow executes, results displayed!

**Check Terminal 2 (worker)** - you should see activity execution!

### 8.5: View in Temporal Web UI

1. Open http://localhost:8233
2. Find your workflow (fraud-order-...)
3. Click on it
4. See the complete execution history!

**This is the power of Temporal - complete visibility!**

---

## Step 9: Compare Before and After

### The Moment of Truth

Now test the **real value** of Temporal: automatic retries!

### Test 1: WITHOUT Temporal (Fails Immediately)

```bash
mvn exec:java@fraud-app -Dexec.args="payment-flaky"
```

**Result:**
```
[Payment] Attempt #1 - FAILED
REJECTED_PAYMENT
```

Only 1 attempt! Workflow dies immediately (70% chance of failure).

**Note:** The `payment-flaky` scenario has a 70% failure rate - you may need to run it multiple times to see a failure.

### Test 2: WITH Temporal (Automatic Retries!)

```bash
mvn exec:java@fraud-workflow -Dexec.args="payment-flaky"
```

**Watch Terminal 2 (worker)!** You'll see:
```
[Payment] Attempt #1 - FAILED
[Payment] Attempt #2 - FAILED
[Payment] Attempt #3 - SUCCESS!
```

**Result:** APPROVED! Temporal kept retrying until it succeeded!

**Note:** With 70% failure rate and 5 retry attempts, success is highly likely!

### View Retries in Web UI

1. Open the workflow in Temporal UI
2. Click on `PaymentChargeActivity`
3. See all retry attempts with timestamps!

**This is the magic of Temporal!** 🎉

## Understanding What You Built

### The Flow

```
1. Starter creates OrderRequest
   ↓
2. Calls workflow.processOrder(request)
   ↓
3. Temporal Server puts it in task queue
   ↓
4. Worker picks it up
   ↓
5. Executes workflow
   → Calls fraudActivity.detectFraud()
   → Calls paymentActivity.chargeCard() (retries if fails!)
   → Calls confirmationActivity.generateMessage()
   ↓
6. Returns FraudOrderResponse
   ↓
7. Starter displays results
```

### Key Benefits

✅ **Automatic Retries** - No manual retry logic needed
✅ **Complete Visibility** - See every step in Web UI
✅ **State Persistence** - Survives crashes
✅ **Fault Tolerance** - Workers can fail and restart
✅ **Scalability** - Add more workers to handle more load

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused"

**Problem:** Temporal Server not running

**Solution:**
```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

### "No workers available"

**Problem:** Task queue name mismatch

**Solution:** Check that `TASK_QUEUE` matches in Worker and Starter!

### Activities never retry

**Problem:** Activity not throwing exceptions

**Solution:** Temporal only retries when activities throw exceptions. Returning a failure result doesn't trigger retries!

---

## Experiments to Try

### 1. Adjust Retry Policies

Try more aggressive retries:
```java
.setMaximumAttempts(10)  // Try 10 times!
.setInitialInterval(Duration.ofMillis(500))  // Start faster
```

### 2. Test Different Failure Scenarios

```bash
# Normal order - payment always succeeds
mvn exec:java@fraud-workflow -Dexec.args="low-risk"

# Flaky payment - 70% failure rate (demonstrates retries)
mvn exec:java@fraud-workflow -Dexec.args="payment-flaky"

# Broken payment - 100% failure (exhausts retries)
mvn exec:java@fraud-workflow -Dexec.args="payment-broken"
```

### 3. Simulate Worker Crash

1. Start a workflow with `payment-flaky` scenario
2. While it's retrying, kill the worker (Ctrl+C in Terminal 2)
3. Restart the worker: `mvn exec:java@fraud-worker`
4. Watch it pick up where it left off!

## Remember

The best way to learn is by doing. Don't just read this guide - actually build each piece yourself. When you get stuck, re-read the relevant section and try to figure it out before looking at example code.

Happy learning! 🚀
